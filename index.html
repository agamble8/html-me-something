                <h2>House & Decorating Projects<a name="house"></a></h2>
                <p class="projtype">No matter how many things I fix or make or re-do in my house there's 
                    always something else to do. Some of the projects are boring but useful 
                    (new hot water heater, I'm looking at you). But some I enjoy more, 
                    both for the process of making and the process of using.</p>

                    <h3>Lamp Refresh</h3>
                    <p>This ugly little brass guy was $3.99 at the thrift store. It was destined for the guest room, but needed a makeover first. It got:</p>

                        <li>Base plate removed and glued back on (no more tape!)</li>

                        <li>Shiny polycrylic finish</li>
                        <li>New shade (which is a little too small, still looking for something bigger but affordable)</li>

                <h3>Pantry Shelves</h3>
                    <p>I've wanted to do this project for so many years, ever since I moved into my current house. This pantry is deep but only had one full-depth shelf and one sliding drawer at the bottom before.
                    I made a whole new set of sliding shelves so you can actually see what's in it and use all the space efficiently.</p>
                    <ol id="list">
                        <li>Measuring and reinforcing the right side so the screws don't go through the wall and the drawer will pass the hinges</li>
                        <li>Installing the sliding rails</li>
                        <li>Painting the 3 new boxes after assembly</li>
                        <li>First drawer box fit. Oops, the middle two are very not level!</li>
                        <li>After sliders were re-leveled and all 4 drawers installed!</li>

                    <h3>Back Porch Refinish</h3>
                    <p>My covered back porch floor was all chipping paint that I'm not sure was ever attractive to begin with. This is the (still ongoing) project to scrape, sand and pressure wash it clean so it can be refinished.</p>

                    <p>I wish I had a better &quot;before&quot; picture of this because it was quite the disorganized mess. Since quarantine I finally got around to
                    buying and hanging some pegboard for my tools in the basement.</p>

                <h3>Office Pegboard</h3>
                        <p>I liked the basement pegboard so much that I used some extra to hang by my desk in my offce. It's about 18x18 and fills a previously blank wall.
                        It was too utilitarian so I added a little vinyl decal as decoration.</p>

                <h3>Upholstered Headboard</h3>
                <p>I made this from scratch for my fiance&#769;'s guest bedroom. It's plywood with holes drilled in it, covered with egg crate foam and fabric. The buttons are made with washer and bolts, covered with fabric and padding. They are put through the holes in the plywood and attached with nuts on the back. There are pine legs that attach to the back of the headboard and the bed frame. This is the sixth headboard I've made with different methods and it's the best method, in terms of looks and sturdiness.</p>

                <h2>Shirts and Other Wearables<a name="shirts"></a></h2>
                <p class="projtype">This year I bought a Cricut cutting machine, which can cut out images based on .svg files. Not going to lie, I don't design my own cut files (yet).
                I get them from free sites online or purchase from professional designers. The Cricut software lets you import your image files, customize, resize, etc.
                Then it cuts them from whatever material you choose. I primarly use HTV (heat transfer vinyl) for shirts and regular adhesive vinyl for decals, but it 
                can also cut fabric, cardstock and many other materials as well. After it's cut I iron the patterns onto various fabric items.</p>
